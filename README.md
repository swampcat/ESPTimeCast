## 🪛 Wiring - OCT 17 - Important Hardware Update ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️

**Pin assignments have been standardized across all Wemos D1 Mini and S2 Mini boards!**  
Check your board version and make sure **your sketch matches the new pin layout**, especially note that **`CLK` is now on `D5` (was `D6`)**.

After testing, we found that powering the MAX7219 matrix from the **D1 Mini’s 3.3V pin** can cause **overheating and unstable display behavior**, so we’re now officially powering the display from the **5V USB rail** instead.  
This change improves **brightness**, **stability**, and protects the **onboard voltage regulator** from long-term damage.

> **Note:** Pin positions on the header remain the same, but ensure your sketch uses the correct pin definitions.

#### What’s Changing

- **Before:** Display VCC was connected to the **3.3V** pin on the ESP board  
- **Now:** Display VCC connects to the **5V** pin (direct from USB power)  
- **CLK:** moved from **D6 → D5**

#### Why This Change Is Needed

- Standardized pin assignment across all Wemos D1 Mini and S2 Mini boards  
- The **MAX7219** LED matrix is designed for **5V operation**  
- The **AMS1117 3.3V regulator** on most D1 Minis has limited current (~800 mA max, often less)  
- High-brightness displays (especially green/yellow) can overload it, causing:
  - Overheating  
  - Voltage drop  
  - Regulator failure (some users saw only **2.4 V** output after damage)

#### Benefits of Using 5V

- Brighter and more stable display output  
- Reduced heat load on the ESP board  
- Prevents long-term regulator damage  
- No level shifters required — **MAX7219 works fine with 3.3V logic signals**


#### Next Steps

- Double-check your board wiring before powering on  
- Update your sketch pin definitions if you’re upgrading from an older build  
- Reference the diagram below for correct wiring (coming next)

#### 🧩 Board → MAX7219 

| D1 Mini (Micro USB) | D1 Mini (USB C) | D1 Mini (ESP 32) | S2 Mini | MAX7219 |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:------|
|  GND  |  GND  |  GND  |  GND  |  GND  |
|  5V   |  5V/VBUS   |  5V/VBUS   |  5V/VBUS   |  VCC  | 
|  D5   |  14   |  18   |  7    |  CLK  | 
|  D7   |  13   |  23   |  11   |  CS   |
|  D8   |  15   |  5    |  12   |  DIN  |


<img src="assets/wiring3.png" alt="Wiring" width="800" />

> **Tip:** Always double-check that VCC (5V), GND, and DIN/CS/CLK match your MAX7219 module’s pin order — different modules sometimes label them differently.

## 🏠 ESPTimeCast Home Assistant Integration

This guide explains how to integrate **ESPTimeCast** with **Home Assistant** to send custom messages to your LED display.

#### 🧠 Overview

ESPTimeCast exposes a REST API endpoint that lets you send **scrolling messages** to the display from either **Home Assistant** or the built-in **Web UI**.

- **Web UI messages** are **persistent** — they remain active until manually cleared via the Web UI.  
- **Home Assistant messages** are **temporary overrides** - they appear immediately but do not modify the saved Web UI message.
- **When cleared from HA** - the display will resume showing the previously saved UI message on the next update loop.

#### 🔗 Endpoint

```
POST http://<device_ip>/set_custom_message
```


#### 📝 Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|------------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `message` | string | Yes | Message text to display. Send an empty string (`""`) to clear messages. |
| `speed` | integer | Optional | Scrolling speed (range **10–200**). Lower values = **faster** scroll. |



#### 💡 Behavior

| Source | Behavior | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Home Assistant** | Displays message temporarily (until next mode rotation or clear). | Restores any saved Web UI message afterward. |
| **Web UI** | Displays message persistently until manually cleared. | Acts as a permanent banner or ticker. |
| **Clear command from Web UI** | Clears *all* messages (HA + UI). | Use this to reset the display completely. |
| **Clear command from Home Assistant** | Clears only the temporary HA message. | UI message will reappear if one was saved. |



#### ⚙️ Example Automations

#### 1. Send a Temporary HA Message

```yaml
alias: Notify Door Open on ESPTimeCast
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.front_door
    to: "on"
action:
  - service: rest_command.esptimecast_message
    data:
      message: "DOOR OPEN"
      speed: 60  # lower = faster
```

#### 2. Clear the Message

```yaml
alias: Clear ESPTimeCast Message
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.front_door
    to: "off"
action:
  - service: rest_command.esptimecast_message
    data:
      message: ""
```


#### 🧩 Example `rest_command` Configuration

Add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
rest_command:
  esptimecast_message:
    url: "http://<device_ip>/set_custom_message"
    method: POST
    content_type: "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
    payload: "message={{ message }}&speed={{ speed | default(85) }}"
```

Then restart Home Assistant.

#### ⚡ Quick Test via curl
You can quickly test sending a message to your ESPTimeCast display using `curl` from any computer on the same network:

```
curl -X POST -d "message=HELLO WORLD&speed=50" "http://<device_ip>/set_custom_message"
```
> Replace <device_ip> with the IP of your ESPTimeCast device.  
> The message parameter is your text to display.  
> The optional speed parameter controls the scroll speed (10–200, lower = faster).

#### 🧾 Notes

- Only **A–Z, 0–9**, spaces, and simple punctuation (`: ! ' - . , _ + % / ?`) are allowed.  
- All text is automatically converted to **uppercase**.
- Lower scroll speed values make the message **scroll faster**.
- Custom Message scroll speed can be changed via this endpoint.

#### ✅ Example Use Cases

- Temporary alerts like **DOOR OPEN**, **RAIN STARTING**, or **MAIL DELIVERED**.  
- Persistent ticker messages from the Web UI like **WELCOME HOME** or **ESPTIMECAST LIVE**.  
- Combine both: Web UI for a base banner, and HA for transient automation messages.


&nbsp;
## 🧩 Hidden & Advanced Features

ESPTimeCast includes a few optional “power-user” features that aren’t visible in the main interface but can be accessed directly from your browser. These are intended for advanced users who want more control or integration.

#### 💾 `/export`
Downloads your current configuration (`config.json`) directly from the device.  
This is useful for creating backups or migrating settings between devices.

**Example:**  
```
http://your-device-ip/export
```
The file will download automatically with your saved WiFi credentials (safely masked for security) and all other settings.

#### 📂 `/upload`
Lets you manually upload a configuration file (`config.json`) to the device.  
Perfect for restoring a backup or quickly switching between setups.

**Usage:**
1. Go to  
   ```
   http://your-device-ip/upload
   ```
2. Select your edited or backup `config.json` file.  
3. The device will confirm the upload and automatically reboot with the new configuration.

> *Tip:* You can export → edit the file on your computer → re-upload to test new settings without using the web interface.

#### ⚕️ Nightscout Integration
ESPTimeCast supports displaying glucose data from **Nightscout** servers alongside weather information.

When the secondary NTP/URL field (`ntpServer2`) contains a valid Nightscout API endpoint for example:  
```
https://your-cgm-server/api/v1/entries/current.json?token=xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
the device automatically enables **Glucose Display Mode**.

In this mode:
- The device fetches glucose data every 5 minutes.
- Glucose value and trend direction are displayed alternately with time and weather.
- The display duration for Nightscout data is the same as the weather display duration.
- Weather data continues to display normally.
- Debug logs confirm updates and Nightscout responses in the Serial Monitor.

#### ⚠️ Notes
- These features are optional and hidden from the main interface to avoid clutter.  
- `/upload` and `/export` are intentionally unlinked from the UI to prevent accidental access.  
- Always verify your WiFi credentials and tokens before uploading edited configurations.

&nbsp;

        * `AsyncTCP` by ESP32Async
        * `ESPAsyncWebServer` by ESP32Async

#### ⬆️ Uploading the Code and Data

Once your Arduino IDE is set up for your board (as described above):

1.  **Open the Project Folder:**
    * For ESP8266: Navigate to and open the `ESPTimeCast_ESP8266` project folder. Inside, you'll find the main sketch file, typically named `ESPTimeCast_ESP8266.ino`. Open this `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
    * For ESP32: Navigate to and open the `ESPTimeCast_ESP32` project folder. Inside, you'll find the main sketch file, typically named `ESPTimeCast_ESP32.ino`. Open this `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
2. **Upload the Sketch:**
    * With the main sketch file open, click the "Upload" button (the right arrow icon) in the Arduino IDE toolbar. This will compile the sketch and upload it to your board..
3.  **Upload `/data` folder (LittleFS):**
    * This project uses LittleFS for storing web interface files and other assets. You'll need the LittleFS Uploader plugin.
    * [**Install the LittleFS Uploader Plugin**](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/arduino-ide-2-install-esp8266-littlefs/) 
    * **Before uploading, ensure the Serial Monitor is closed.**
    * Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows, `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
    * Search for and run: `Upload LittleFS to Pico/ESP8266/ESP32` (the exact command name might vary).
    * **Important for ESP32:** If the upload fails, you might need to manually put your ESP32 into "Download Mode." While holding down the **Boot button** (often labeled 'BOOT' or 'IO0' or 'IO9'), briefly press and release the **RST button**, then release the Boot button.

&nbsp;
## 📺 Display Behavior

**ESPTimeCast** automatically switches between two display modes: Clock and Weather.
If "Show Weather Description" is enabled, a third mode (Description) will display with a duration of 3 seconds, if the description is too long to fit on the display the description will scroll from right to left once.

What you see on the LED matrix depends on whether the device has successfully fetched the current time (via NTP) and weather (via OpenWeatherMap).  
The following table summarizes what will appear on the display in each scenario:

| Display Mode | 🕒 NTP Time | 🌦️ Weather Data | 📺 Display Output                              |
|:------------:|:----------:|:--------------:|:--------------------------------------------|
| **Clock**    | ✅ Yes      | —              | 🗓️ Day Icon + ⏰ Time (e.g. `@ 14:53`)           |
| **Clock**    | ❌ No       | —              |  `! NTP` (NTP sync failed)               |
| **Weather**  | —          | ✅ Yes         | 🌡️ Temperature (e.g. `23ºC`)                |
| **Weather**  | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No          | 🗓️ Day Icon + ⏰ Time (e.g. `@ 14:53`)           |
| **Weather**  | ❌ No       | ❌ No          |  `! TEMP` (no weather or time data)       |

#### How it works:

- The display automatically alternates between **Clock** and **Weather** modes (the duration for each is configurable).
- If "Show Weather Description" is enabled a third mode **Description** will display after the **Weather** display with a duration of 3 seconds.
- In **Clock** mode, if NTP time is available, you’ll see the current time plus a unique day-of-week icon. If NTP is not available, you'll see `! NTP`.
- In **Weather** mode, if weather is available, you’ll see the temperature (like `23ºC`). If weather is not available but time is, it falls back to showing the clock. If neither is available, you’ll see `! TEMP`.
- All status/error messages (`! NTP`, `! TEMP`) are big icons shown on the display.

**Legend:**
- 🗓️ **Day Icon**: Custom symbol for day of week (`@`, `=`, etc.)
- ⏰ **Time**: Current time (HH:MM)
- 🌡️ **Temperature**: Weather from OpenWeatherMap
- ✅ **Yes**: Data available
- ❌ **No**: Data not available
- — : Value does not affect this mode
